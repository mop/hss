I have been having this weird \n   issue where when I ssh to a remote box, and fire up screen, backspace stops \n   working properly. I can change the terminal property in OS X to send <code>^H</code>, but\n   then things like telnet and nsupdate start to fail hard. No good!\n</p>\n<p>So today I decided to work on it. I after some googling, I decided to ask \n   <a href=\"http://phraktured.net\" title=\"phrakture - can lift a car over his head\">phrakture</a> for some of his terminfo mastery.\n</p>\n<ol>\n <li><p>I got the TERM variable from the OSX box, and the remote box (which was a \n   ubuntu gutsy install), and compared them. \n</p>\n<pre><code>$ echo $TERM\n xterm-color\n$ ssh remotebox\n$ echo $TERM\n xterm-color\n$ screen -R failwhale\n$ echo $TERM\n screen\n$ exit\n$ exit\n</code></pre><p>So far so good. I got <code>xterm-color</code> for local, remote, and <code>screen</code> inside\n   of remote screen.\n</p>\n\n </li>\n\n <li><p>I wanted to see what the terms thought I was sending them. So locally, and\n   remotely, and then remotely inside screen, I did a <code>C-v &lt;backspace&gt;</code>. \n   Locally and remotely I got <code>^?</code> for the backspace key. Remotely inside \n   screen I got <code>^[[3~</code>.\n</p>\n\n </li>\n\n <li><p>I checked my bash dotfiles to make sure I wasn't forcing any goofy things.\n   I wasn't. yay!\n</p>\n\n </li>\n\n <li><p>phrakture had me test on an ArchLinux box. I have a few running, so this \n   was no problem. The Arch box had no problem. Further, remotely in the Arch\n   box and inside screen, <code>C-v &lt;backspace&gt;</code> showed me <code>^?</code>. This was a <code>ding</code> \n   moment for me, as I hadn't before noticed that only debian based systems\n   presented this problem to me. It had never clicked until then. Not random!\n</p>\n\n </li>\n\n <li><p>Next step was to look at the terminfo data for xterm-color. I had\n   previously installed ncurses-term on ubuntu, so I had all the terminfos I\n   thought I needed. I copied the ArchLinux terminfo for xterm-color to the\n   ubuntu box, and put it in a home dir, so I could compare them easily with\n   infocmp.\n</p>\n<pre><code>$ mkdir ~/.terminfo/a/\n$ scp remote-arch:/usr/share/terminfo/x/xterm-color .terminfo/a/arch-xterm-color\n$ infocmp xterm-color arch-xterm-color\n  comparing xterm-color to arch-xterm-color.\n  comparing booleans.\n  comparing numbers.\n  comparing strings.\n    hts: NULL, '\\EH'.\n    kdch1: '\\177', '\\E[3~'.\n    kend: '\\E[4~', NULL.\n    kfnd: NULL, '\\E[1~'.\n    khome: '\\E[1~', NULL.\n    kslt: NULL, '\\E[4~'.\n</code></pre><p>Whoah. That doesn't seem right, and phrakture agreed. Note the <code>kdch1</code> \n   values. Phrakture informed me that <code>kdch1</code> is the backspace key.  \n</p>\n\n </li>\n\n <li><p>Some additional googlitued turned up this <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=319554\" title=\"debian terminfo failboat\">bug report</a>.\n   Facepalms ensued. Thanks debian! :/\n</p>\n\n </li>\n</ol>\n<p>So how did I fix it?\n</p>\n<pre><code>$ mv .terminfo/a/arch-xterm-color /usr/share/terminfo/x/xterm-color\n</code></pre><p>Now everything works great! I was pleased to find that I do not have problems \n   ssh'ing from the ubuntu install that I changed this on, to other *nix boxen. I \n   was afraid there would be some reliance inside the debian core on those odd \n   terminfo values, but it didn't seem to hurt to remove them.\n</p>", homepage = "http://cactuswax.net/articles/debian-ubuntu-terminfo-hijinks/", isRead = True},RssItem {title = "Arch-live Development Blog: Arch-live 20080723 release", content = "Changes since 20080714:<br />kernel26slax updated to 2.6.26<br />madwifi-slax package added<br />gspcav1-slax package added<br />added xine-lib in xorg to make it possible to do a arch-live-mini (300MB?)<br /><a href=\"http://xfce-look.org/content/show.php/Archmousel?content=84188\">desktop artwork</a><br />slim theme is now archlinux-darch-white.<br /><br />Added packages:<br />crack-attack<br />dragonhunt<br />ltris<br />fceu<br />snes9x-gtk<br />gfceu<br />generator<br />simdock<br />xfmedia<br />vlc<br />audacity<br />mino<br />qalculate-gtk<br />emesene<br /><br />Removed packages:<br />there are no dep module of kdemod and kdemod4 anymore<br />I upload it <a href=\"http://arch-live.isawsome.net/modules/Extra/\">here</a>.
